Enter  Hono.js , a minimalist yet powerful framework designed to thrive in cutting-edge environments like Cloudflare Workers, Deno, and Bun. While still relatively under the radar, Hono.js is quickly carving out a niche for developers who want a no-nonsense, high-performance solution for building web apps and APIs.\\nWhy Hono.js Stands Out\\nBlazing Fast and Lightweight:\\nHono.js prioritizes speed and efficiency. Its ultra-small size means it doesn’t bog down your application with unnecessary overhead, making it ideal for performance-critical projects.\\nModern by Design:\\nHono.js embraces environments that define the future of web development, such as edge computing platforms like Cloudflare Workers. This makes it an excellent choice for developers looking to push their apps closer to users for lightning-fast responses.\\nFamiliar Yet Innovative:\\nIf you’ve worked with Express.js, Hono.js will feel like a familiar friend with a sharper edge. It retains the simplicity of Express but introduces more modern concepts, all while staying highly modular.\\nTypeScript First:\\nSay goodbye to guesswork! Hono.js comes with full TypeScript support, ensuring you can write maintainable and robust code without sacrificing developer experience.\\nA Growing Ecosystem:\\nWith a solid foundation for middleware and plugin support, Hono.js is steadily growing an ecosystem that meets real-world demands. From authentication to caching, developers can extend functionality without friction.\\nWhy Hono.js Has a Bright Future  🌟\\nThe development landscape is evolving rapidly, with increasing demand for tools that deliver  efficiency ,  scalability , and  modernity . Hono.js checks all these boxes while remaining refreshingly straightforward.\\nIts focus on edge-native environments positions it perfectly for the rise of  serverless computing ,  microservices , and  distributed architectures . With more developers experimenting with platforms like Deno and Bun, Hono.js is likely to see significant adoption in the coming years.\\nMoreover, its lightweight nature makes it a great fit for startups and solo developers who want speed without sacrificing quality.\\nWhen Should You Try Hono.js?\\nYou’re building an API or web app that needs to be lean and fast.\\nYou want to deploy on modern platforms like Cloudflare Workers, Deno, or Bun.\\nYou love Express.js, but you’re ready for something lighter and more future-proof.\\nClosing Thoughts\\nHono.js might not have the massive community of giants like Express or Next.js—yet—but its potential is undeniable. It offers developers a chance to explore cutting-edge tools while staying productive and efficient. Whether you\\'re building the next big thing or a small side project, Hono.js is worth a look.\\nThe web development world moves fast. Hono.js ensures you stay ahead. 🛠️\\nTop comments  (35)\\nSubscribe\\nPersonal\\nTrusted User\\nCreate template\\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\\nSubmit\\nPreview\\nDismiss\\nCollapse\\nExpand\\ngunslingor\\ngunslingor\\ngunslingor\\nFollow\\nJoined\\nFeb 17, 2023\\n•\\nDec 3\\n• Edited on  Dec 3\\n• Edited\\nDropdown menu\\nCopy link\\nHide\\nLooks like 1000 things before, a clone of a pure node based api wrapper. Seems like a pretty basic implementation, doesn\\'t seem to allow enforced hierarchical routing, routes are burried in a func. Not sure why anyone would pick this over express, if nothing more than by comparing documentation and proven use cases. What does it have to offer over the other clones, hard objective numbers... the words in bold in the article are marketing terms... unless you can prove it has better \"efficiency, scalability, and modernity\" than all others... good luck 🤣.\\nLike comment:\\nLike comment:\\n20 \\xa0likes\\nLike\\nComment button\\nReply\\nCollapse\\nExpand\\nFlorian Rappl\\nFlorian Rappl\\nFlorian Rappl\\nFollow\\nSolution Architect in the IoT space with a fable for distributed computing.

For instance, if you want to run today on Cloudflare Worker, tomorrow on AWS Lambda and next week on some other platform that may not have a full Node.js runtime then hono is useful. It brings those platforms into a common API. You build once and the adapters guarantee that it can be shipped to those.\\nThat\\'s also why it is being used by many frameworks as the working horse underneath. It is an abstraction over the potential deployment targets.\\nLike comment:\\nLike comment:\\n7 \\xa0likes\\nLike\\nComment button\\nReply\\nCollapse\\nExpand\\nJoodi\\nJoodi\\nJoodi\\nFollow\\n𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘁-𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿 sharing what I learn.

Totally agree—Hono’s real strength is its flexibility across runtimes and platforms. For Node.js-specific projects, Express or Fastify can definitely be great picks, but Hono’s abstraction makes it shine in edge-native and multi-platform setups.

I totally get where you’re coming from, and I really appreciate your feedback. Let me address a couple of the points you raised:\\nAbout routing: Hono.js is designed to be super lightweight and minimalist. It might not enforce \"hierarchical routing\" out of the box, but it’s got simplicity and flexibility that many developers really value.\\nComparison with Express: 100% agree that Express is a rock-solid tool with amazing documentation and proven reliability. But Hono.js is built with modern environments like Cloudflare Workers in mind, where speed and a small footprint really make a difference.\\nOn \"efficiency and scalability\": I get that these words might sound like marketing buzzwords, but they genuinely reflect what Hono.js aims to achieve—especially in edge-native platforms like Deno or Bun. I promise I’ll include benchmarks and real-world examples in future posts to back this up!\\nThanks again for bringing this up—it’s feedback like yours that sparks great discussions and helps improve things!

I totally get your preference for the Express 5 error handling style—it does feel more structured. But it\\'s good to know that Hono\\'s approach is still practical and efficient.

Hono.js is for JavaScript/TypeScript, while FastAPI is designed for Python.\\nLike comment:\\nLike comment:\\n4 \\xa0likes\\nLike\\nComment button\\nReply\\nCollapse\\nExpand\\nYeshua Osvaldo\\nYeshua Osvaldo\\nYeshua Osvaldo\\nFollow\\nC# / Typescript / Rust / Python.\\nAstro + Alpine.\\nPronouns\\nHe/Him\\nJoined\\nNov 9, 2024\\n•\\nDec 4\\nDropdown menu\\nCopy link\\nHide\\nGOOD! Soon, we are going to work with Deno 2 and the framework to run will be HonoJS, is a new thing and the new and MODERN workfload is the way to go ;). Here we work with C# (Razor Pages / MVC for enterprise level / client\\'s poject \"), the most workfload to almost all withgs is a combination that has AstroJS in everything because the simple and optimized way from it:\\nAstro + Alpine (all static and basic things where CSS + Alpine can afford with basic integrations)\\nAstro + HTMX + Alpine (when simple server is needed for a determined project)\\nAstro + HTMX + Svelte / Qwik \"in Astro Island \" (when the bigger need of interactivity by JS is really needed)\\nDeno 2 + Honor will be a grreat tool to add to our workfload and I can\\'t wait to try it for the next weeks.\\nObs.: for all those like us that settled up Astro like \"the\" framework tool, with Deno 2 you can go with the Astro Projects without need to touch Node ;) I hope Honor focus in Deno 2 because developers that appreciate a modern workfload will go with Hono to work with Deno 2 ... We are searching and analysing all frameworks to choose the best to work with Deno 2, Typescript is our way to go, there\\'s no JavaScript thinking in the company, Hono and Deno seems like the obvious couple, Deno righ now is getting a new way to play Tyepescript, but now is too late, the company is now focusing in modern web development tools. Even with the .NET workload the modern Razor Pages is the standard way for us to begin project, MVC is only used to specific\\'s project, like with Astro when interactivity (massive dynamic) is need the company way is Svelte in Astro Island and now we are training to use Qwik, a steeper learning courve instead React(I always preffered Svelte instead react), I used to work with sveltekit and love it until I met Astro that \"if\" need, I can use Svelte in Island, only what is need to accomplish the job), but I am impressed with Qwik, but was my first touch with it, I am still reading the specs, next three weeks before ending the month (december) I already will have a deeper undestanding about Qwik in truth.\\nCheers up! To modern Develop \\\\o/\\nCheers up! To Deno 2 that really deserves in version 2, must continue focus on modern workload\\nCheers up! To Hono, to make a perfect couple with Deno (continuing to work hard with DENO 2)\\nobs.: a possible Cheers up! for Astro Team (I guess maybe if they don\\'t, some others can create soon one likely to benefit the modern technology, where a JS world with frontend frameworks change constantly, we need to get updated in our skills) to rebuild Astro using Deno 2 instead Node lol ....\\nLike comment:\\nLike comment:\\n2 \\xa0likes\\nLike\\nComment button\\nReply\\nCollapse\\nExpand\\nJoodi\\nJoodi\\nJoodi\\nFollow\\n𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘁-𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿 sharing what I learn.

My intention was never to criticize Express.js, but rather to highlight the strengths of Hono.js and compare some of their differences. Express remains one of the most powerful and popular tools in the developer community, which is why I mentioned that Hono.js would feel familiar to those experienced with Express. If my tone came across as dismissive of Express, I sincerely apologize—that was not my intention. I appreciate your feedback and will strive to make my comparisons clearer and more balanced in the future.\\nLike comment:\\nLike comment:\\n1 \\xa0like\\nLike\\nComment button\\nReply\\nView full discussion (35 comments)\\nCode of Conduct\\n•\\nReport abuse\\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?
